Plataphorma
===========

Meteor pet project created to teach my students the following Meteor functionality:

* Usage of allow to control client access to collections

Plataphorma offers the possibility to run 2 different HTML5 games: Alien Invasion and Froot Wars. 

On the right side of the screen the best players of each game are shown, updated in real time each time a signed in player finishes a game. If no game is selected, the best players overall are shown.

On the left side of the screen a chatroom for the current game is available. Only signed in users can post messages. If no game is selected a general chatroom is shown.

The original code of the two HTML5 games integrated in this project is available here:
* Alien Invasion: https://github.com/cykod/AlienInvasion
* Froot Wars: http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Professional-HTML5-Mobile-Game-Development.productCd-1118301323,descCd-DOWNLOAD.html
